## My process :computer:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Git and Github

### What I learned

Using Grid to offset the location of boxes, creating a
brick bond style.

```sass
.fcf__body
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr)
  column-gap: 1.4rem

.fcf__card-supervisor
  grid-column: 1 / 3
  grid-row: 2 / 3
  justify-self: end
```

### Continued development

Even though it is stronger than when the challenge begun I could always do with more practice using Grids.
