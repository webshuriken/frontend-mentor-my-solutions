### Setup

The project does not require any setup. The SASS file has already been compiled to CSS for immediate use.
- Clone the repo
- Open folder and start playing with the code

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile first approach
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

There are two things which I learned when working on this project:

1. `background-position`

It can be used to move the image used as a background in an element.. but is important to understand how the values in the property are used.

```css
background-image: url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
background-position: right 52vw top -284px, left 45vw top 355px;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-size: cover;
```

2. SASS

It is easy to pick up and very useful. The appeal to use in large projects is obvious. Here is a very simple mixin:

```sass
@mixin rootSpecs($fontFamily: sans-serif, $fontSize: 18px)
  font-family: $fontFamily, sans-serif
  font-size: $fontSize
```

### Continued development

SASS preprocessor is still new to me and I would like to focus on developing this skill. It turned out to be helpful even on this small scale.

### Useful resources

The project was not hard but I did have to look up the CSS `background-position` property.
From all the pages I visited **only two** had useful information:

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/) pointed out the 4 types of values you can use.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) explains, in detail, how the values are taken and used by the property.
